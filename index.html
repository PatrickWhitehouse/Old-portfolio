                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Patrick Whitehouse, a front end developer based in Tameside, Manchester.</p>
            <p>I work as a front end developer, mainly working with Magento, for <a href="https://pushon.co.uk" target="_blank">PushON</a>, who are located
              just outside Manchester city centre.</p>
            <p>
              I have a passion for cars and currently drive an Abarth 500. I also have a passion for photography and I <strong>try</strong> and combine the two together using a Canon, iPhone X and <a href="//instagram.com/p44adx">Instagram</a>.
            </p>
            <p>I am eager to stay up to date with the latest technology trends that are constantly evolving on a daily basis. I have to admit though, it's almost impossible to focus directly on one language or framework, there is simply too many being released in such a short amount of time, especially front end frameworks.</p>

            <h3>The tech stack I use on a daily basis</h3>
            <p>As previously mentioned, my day job is working as a front end developer for an agency who develop Magento sites. Prior to this, I had never touched Magento. Over the past two years working with Magento on a daily basis, my skill set and knowledge has expanded and I can proudly say, I'm a <a href="https://u.magento.com/certification/directory/dev/2593600/" target="_blank">certified front end Magento 2 developer</a>.</p>
            <p>On a daily basis, I use the following:
                <ul class="tech-stack">
                    <li>Ubuntu</li>
                    <li>SCSS</li>
                    <li>LESS</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>XML</li>
                    <li>HTML and PHTML</li>
                    <li>JS, Knockout JS, jQuery</li>
                    <li>Docker</li>
                    <li>Photo editing software</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
